By the timeÅ@I finish writing "Deeper and more fun" ÅA
The success of young Shogi pro, Fujii 8 dan has begun
 to become a hot topic. Inspired by it
Next time I decided to write a defense book, gathered hands, and sometimes
I recorded it in a diary style and continued to study and research it


How good defense is against the opponent's play Sometimes
Respect the reasoning inference or what is ideal
I know it's not easy, but I challenge myself as much as possible
I wrote it as a culmination of my own experience and knowledge.


Due to the influence of the coronavirus, the number of nests increases and BBO
I received an invitation,
 but I will do my best without losing the temptation I did.

Useful comments about the original electronic version and a little better
Many people pointed out that there is a pr-, and exchanged opinions.
I've done it several times.

I'm just shining the spotlight as a defense issue


In particular, we received valuable advice from Mr. Emomoto and Mr. Nose.
I tried to improve it.

Not only both of them, but everyone who cooperated in various ways
Thank you.

Eventually the corona turmoil will end and the high b-bridge of LebeL again
I will write it in the hope that the day will come when I can enjoy it.
